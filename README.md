# Fount

Fount is a distributed runtime environment targeted general simulations with an emphasis on high availability and fault tolerance. It features the following:
- Distributed Compute
- Cluster Management
- GPU-On-Demand Capability
- Custom Scheduling
- A Dead-Simple SystemD-Based API
  - Includes a built-in C++ API as well
  - Includes a Python-Wrapper (Not a main goal)
- An Open API to Be Extensible For External/Internal Tooling and Monitoring

### System Overview
![overview](https://github.com/Vi1i/fount/blob/master/fount.png)
Fount provides a robust runtime execution environment for distributed simulations. It handles all of the optimal scheduling, distribution, and orchestration of resources via a unified framework. It aims to be a low-barrier toolkit for quickly prototyping HPC workflows.
