// If SIGTERM is received, shut down the daemon and exit cleanly.
// If SIGHUP is received, reload the configuration files, if this applies.
//TODO: (Vi1i) The skeleton code is done below.

// Provide a correct exit code from the main daemon process, as this is used by the init system to detect service errors and problems. It is recommended to follow the exit code scheme as defined in the LSB recommendations for SysV init scripts.
//TODO: (Vi1i) Setup/look into the exit codes.

// If possible and applicable, expose the daemon's control interface via the D-Bus IPC system and grab a bus name as last step of initialization.
//TODO: (Vi1i) This is definitly a use case we will need. So we will have to investigate it, I believe there are some ...

// For integration in systemd, provide a .service unit file that carries information about starting, stopping and otherwise maintaining the daemon. See systemd.service(5) for details.
// As much as possible, rely on the init system's functionality to limit the access of the daemon to files, services and other resources, i.e. in the case of systemd, rely on systemd's resource limit control instead of implementing your own, rely on systemd's privilege dropping code instead of implementing it in the daemon, and similar. See systemd.exec(5) for the available controls.
//TODO: (Vi1i) This means that we don't handle the PID, forking, etc. that used to be required in the older init systems.

// If D-Bus is used, make your daemon bus-activatable by supplying a D-Bus service activation configuration file. This has multiple advantages: your daemon may be started lazily on-demand; it may be started in parallel to other daemons requiring it â€” which maximizes parallelization and boot-up speed; your daemon can be restarted on failure without losing any bus requests, as the bus queues requests for activatable services. See below for details.
//TODO: (Vi1i) See the previous bus todo. This section gives another reason to do this.

// If your daemon provides services to other local processes or remote clients via a socket, it should be made socket-activatable following the scheme pointed out below. Like D-Bus activation, this enables on-demand starting of services as well as it allows improved parallelization of service start-up. Also, for state-less protocols (such as syslog, DNS), a daemon implementing socket-based activation can be restarted without losing a single request. See below for details.
//TODO: (Vi1i) We will in the future atleast need this, so might as well get cracking.

// If applicable, a daemon should notify the init system about startup completion or status updates via the sd_notify(3) interface.
//TODO: (Vi1i) Shown below, but really we need this to be manageable in any place that can determing state.

// Instead of using the syslog() call to log directly to the system syslog service, a new-style daemon may choose to simply log to standard error via fprintf(), which is then forwarded to syslog by the init system. If log levels are necessary, these can be encoded by prefixing individual log lines with strings like "<4>" (for log level 4 "WARNING" in the syslog priority scheme), following a similar style as the Linux kernel's printk() level system. For details, see sd-daemon(3) and systemd.exec(5).
//TODO: (Vi1i) We need to log to correctly here, something like spdlog might be useful as it allows us to set "sinks" and each sink can have its configuration.
//TODO: (Vi1i) Though we could also handle this our selves with some more simplicty.
